## P0.1 — Perf harness: kernels, build, ISA metrics on MI250
Date: 2026-11-02   Outcome: Done
PR: not opened (`gh` is not installed on this host). Branch pushed: https://github.com/ReetBarik/xpmath-kokkos/compare/main...gpuperf/p0.1-perf-harness?expand=1
Changed:
- CMakeLists.txt: option XPMATH_KOKKOS_BUILD_PERF (OFF) + add_subdirectory(perf)
- perf/{CMakeLists.txt,kernels.hpp,unit.cpp,perf_main.cpp}: 90 kernels, 12 per-(kind,type) object units, target xpk_perf_isa
- perf/{isa_metrics.sh,isa_metrics_hip.py}: gfx90a metrics from -save-temps device .s
- perf/README.md; perf/results/gfx90a/isa_v0.3.0.csv (90 rows)
Checks: ctest -N = 13 with perf OFF and ON (pass); vendor_fresh (pass); HIP gfx90a build on login node (pass, /tmp/p01-gfx90a-build.log); Serial build + run of all 90 kernels (pass, /tmp/p01-serial-run.log). Not run on a GPU (not needed).
Measured (MI250, xpmath v0.3.0; scratch bytes, calls): double mul 0 B, 0; DD add 24 B; DD mul 96 B, 1 call; DD log 416 B, 9 calls; cDD log 1488 B, 51 calls. double/float/cdouble/cfloat: all 0 B, 0 calls.
Next session must know:
- Build only `--target xpk_perf_isa` (default target also builds the tests). Recipe is in perf/README.md; configure needs -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc and rocm/7.0.2.
- Metrics are keyed off `<build>/perf/xp_version.txt` (tag from vendor/UPSTREAM.txt, or `git describe` of XPMATH_KOKKOS_PERF_XP_DIR). XP_DIR=~/kokkos-extended-precision-demo works; that clone is the plan's "~/xpmath" and is 8 commits past v0.3.0 locally.
- `regs` = .vgpr_count + .agpr_count; `code_bytes`/`instructions`/`calls` are summed over the kernel and every function reachable by direct call (static counts). The parser exits nonzero if the kernel set is not exactly the expected 90, or if codeLenInByte contradicts the instruction count.
- exp domain is type-dependent: |x| <= 700 for double/DD, <= 80 for float-range types (they overflow past ~88). Complex abs/etc. use the same Kokkos:: forwards as the wrappers.
- P0.2 adds CUDA (cuobjdump/resource usage) and gfx942 by extending the `case` in isa_metrics.sh; the harness sources need no change.
